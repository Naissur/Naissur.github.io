<p>Hot keys make it more efficient to use any product, but they have a <em>steep learning curve</em>.
You have to train a lot in order to get them into your <strong>muscle memory</strong>. Take <em>Vim</em>, for example:</p>

<p>There is, of course, a <strong>minimal starting keys set</strong> you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>i</em> for <strong>entering the Insertion Mode</strong></li>
  <li><em>&lt;Escape&gt;</em> for <strong>entering the Normal Mode</strong></li>
  <li><em>hjkl/arrow keys</em> for <strong>moving the cursor</strong></li>
  <li><em>:w</em> for <strong>saving the buffer</strong></li>
  <li><em>:q</em> for <strong>closing Vim</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Five commands - seems pretty basic. But you have to learn that <em>Vim</em> uses a concept of <strong>modes</strong>.
That is a first non-trivial obstacle. But much more lies ahead :)</p>

<p>That’s why it is hard to start using <em>Dwm, Vim, terminal, Emacs, Maya, etc.</em></p>

<p>The main <em>True Detective</em> series character, Rust, is not someone you would call a <em>happy person</em>.</p>

<p>Yet, he is, undeniably, <em>smart</em>.
He is cynical, depressed, bored <em>to death</em>. The single thing that drives him is <em>solving the case</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self.
A secretion of sensory experience and feeling.
Programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when, in fact, nobody is anybody.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The depressive things that he tells us, are <strong>one of the hard truths</strong>.
They are true in a sense that one can view the world like that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask most people if mind and body are one and they will say <em>“no”</em>. <br /> This is referred to as <strong>“naïve dualism.”</strong></li>
  <li>Your brain is a prediction and modeling machine. <br /> <strong>Evolutional behavior</strong>.</li>
  <li>The only thing we can control in our lives is our <em>focus</em>. <br /> <strong>Nothing else is under control</strong>.</li>
  <li>The “you” that rationalizes, chooses and deliberates, <br /> is simply <strong>a way for the brain</strong> to navigate the world.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>People… I have seen the finale of thousands of lives man.
Young, old, each one was so sure of their realness.
That their sensory experience constituted a unique individual.
Purpose, meaning.
So certain that they were more than a biological puppet.
Truth wills out, everybody sees once the strings are cut off all down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truth wills out. Thanks for reading.</p>
