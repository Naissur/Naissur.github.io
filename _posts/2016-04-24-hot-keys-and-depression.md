# Hot keys, dwm, muscle memory

Hot keys make it more efficient to use any product, but they have a *steep learning curve*.
You have to train a lot in order to get them into your **muscle memory**. Take *Vim*, for example:

There is, of course, a **minimal starting keys set** you can use:

- *i* for **entering the Insertion Mode**
- *\<Escape\>* for **entering the Normal Mode**
- *hjkl/arrow keys* for **moving the cursor**
- *:w* for **saving the buffer**
- *:q* for **closing Vim**

Five commands - seems pretty basic. But you have to learn that *Vim* uses a concept of **modes**.
That is a first non-trivial obstacle. But much more lies ahead :)

That's why it is hard to start using *Dwm, Vim, terminal, Emacs, Maya, etc.*


# True detective, meaningfulness, Algernon

The main *True Detective* series character, Rust, is not someone you would call a *happy person*.

Yet, he is, undeniably, *smart*.
He is cynical, depressed, bored *to death*. The single thing that drives him is *solving the case*.

> We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self.
> A secretion of sensory experience and feeling.
> Programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when, in fact, nobody is anybody.

The depressive things that he tells us, are **one of the hard truths**.
They are true in a sense that one can view the world like that.

- Ask most people if mind and body are one and they will say *"no"*. <br/> This is referred to as **"na√Øve dualism."**
- Your brain is a prediction and modeling machine. <br/> **Evolutional behavior**.
- The only thing we can control in our lives is our *focus*. <br/> **Nothing else is under control**.
- The "you" that rationalizes, chooses and deliberates, <br /> is simply **a way for the brain** to navigate the world.

> People... I have seen the finale of thousands of lives man.
> Young, old, each one was so sure of their realness.
> That their sensory experience constituted a unique individual.
> Purpose, meaning.
> So certain that they were more than a biological puppet.
> Truth wills out, everybody sees once the strings are cut off all down.

Truth wills out. Thanks for reading.
