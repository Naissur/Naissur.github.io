<h1 id="after-midnight-happiness-choice-mr-nobody-work-life-mind-focus-control-reasons-meaning">After midnight, happiness, choice, Mr. Nobody, work, life, mind, focus, control, reasons, meaning</h1>

<h2 id="what-did-i-do-to-deserve-this">What did I do to deserve this?</h2>

<p>The pigeon superstition. <strong>What can we even control</strong>?</p>

<p>What is the <em>meaning</em> of all this?</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>As a testable truth, we can <em>partially</em> control our <strong>momentary focus</strong>.</p>

<p>Though, it can be influenced by others, which is known as <strong>communication</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Imagine a red car</strong>.
You see - Your focus was shifted to this notion of some red car, meaning I <em>communicated</em> the <em>idea of a red car</em> to you.</p>

<p>Turns out, our:</p>

<ul>
  <li>emotions and feelings</li>
  <li>happiness</li>
  <li>thought process</li>
  <li>body</li>
  <li>instincts</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain">limbic system and the “reptilian brain”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>are <em>not</em> fully under our control. Though, they can be influenced by shifting focus.</p>

<p>The only choice in our lives is what we currently focus on, and whether we influence focus at all.</p>

<h1 id="happiness">Happiness</h1>

<p>No one knows how to be happy. Though, the sheer knowledge of what you can and can’t control might give you room for creating happiness.</p>

<p>We all have our choices. Their <strong>sequence</strong> conformly <strong>maps to chaos</strong> after minutes, months and years.
This, in fact, is the <strong>real us</strong>. Our <strong>choices of momentary focus</strong> is what makes us, <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>I thought about it after midnight in an important relationship. Connection. Whatever it might be called.</p>

<p>Every single choice is the hardest now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before, he was unable to make a choice ‘cause he didn’t know what would happen.
Now that he knows what will happen, he is unable to make a choice.</p>

  <p>(quoted from Mr. Nobody)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
