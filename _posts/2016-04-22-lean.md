# Lean Startup methodology

## The main startup cycle

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR;
    A(Ideas)-. Iterate, build .-> B(Code);
    B-. Measure feedback, get .->C(Data);
    C-. Learn from feedback, generate .->A;
</div>

It has to be **as short as possible**.

## The main startup goal

The main goal of a startup *in Lean Startup methodology* is to create the following cycle:

- build **products** around **ideas**
- measure **users' feedback**
- *make a decision:* is it better to **make a turn, <br /> or to continue moving in the current direction?**

All the startup processes must be **directed towards getting users' feedback as fast as possible**.

## The main question

For an entrepreneur, the main question is: **is the company moving towards a successful business**?

In the first few years, the most important questions should be:

- What product should we create?
- Who should we create it for?

```
Business >= Product + Clients
```


## Starting capital

The *Lean Startup* methodology allows the company to grow, even if it doesn't have *any starting capital at all*.

## Productivity

Productivity **is not** creating more and more new widgets or options.

**It is** making actions in business and product development, which help to create value and company growth.

In another words, *a right turn* moves us closer to *creating a flourishing business*.

## Turns

A *turn* is **not just** an opportunity to change.

It is a special system of structured changes, with a goal of **asserting a new fundamental hypothesis** product, business model, or growth mechanism.

*This is the key* to understanding the *Lean Startup* methodology.
