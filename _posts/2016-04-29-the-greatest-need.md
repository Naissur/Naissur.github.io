# The greatest need

# Connection, meaning, life, "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", Antifragility, controlling chaos, dramatic murder.


<br /> I wondered "Why?",
<br /> And it turned out:
<br /> There's no deny
<br /> That everything - is nothing. Doubt.
<br /> 
<br /> Fine, what do others say?
<br /> Einstein, Steve Jobs -
<br /> Do they just tell themselves, okay,
<br /> into some meaning of these "not"'s'?
<br /> 
<br /> "Creating" is too shallow.
<br /> "Connecting"'s not enough.
<br /> "Creating quality" is good, but not *too* good, though
<br /> The answer's, also, not some "love".
<br /> 
<br /> We live in chaos:
<br /> It is outside and inside.
<br /> And some of humans break; but others...
<br /> Get better from the randomenss, and they survive.
<br />
<br /> The name for it is contrary
<br /> To being fragile: it is named
<br /> *Antifragility*. So, here's my word, accordingly
<br /> By which the life is tamed:
<br />
<br /> The highest need is in:
<br /> Controllably creating
<br /> Of *optional* (to both), and *antifragile* *bond*,
<br /> *With everything*.
<br />
<br /> *A bond* has a *conductor* of some sort.
<br /> For writer - books
<br /> For painter - art, in short,
<br /> For lovers - sex and looks.

<br /> This was a strong,
<br /> Dramatic murder of my dreams.
<br /> And then, you can't go on,
<br /> Once all is simplified, when knowing what it means.
<br />
<br />
<br /> But when we're bonded
<br /> In this way - becoming one,
<br /> Life's colors amplify,
<br /> And quickly fade away, undone.
<br />
<br /> All the colors of the world
<br /> Are both beneath you, and inside.
<br /> The word has to be spread - you're old
<br /> And thoughts - they are too low, too high.
<br />
<br /> And the many has become the one, reborn
<br /> Much more than sum of all:
<br /> Then, everything is broken, twisted, torn,
<br /> *Are bound, your mind and soul.*
