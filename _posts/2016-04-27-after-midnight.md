## WARNING: depth ahead!

# After midnight, happiness, choice, Mr. Nobody, work, life, mind, focus, control, reasons, meaning

## What did I do to deserve this?

The pigeon superstition. **What can we even control**?

What is the *meaning* of all this?

## Focus

As a testable truth, we can *partially* control our **momentary focus**.

Though, it can be influenced by others, which is known as **communication**.

**Imagine a red car**.
You see - Your focus was shifted to this notion of some red car, meaning I *communicated* the *idea of a red car* to you.

Turns out, our:

- emotions and feelings
- happiness
- thought process
- body
- instincts
- [the limbic system and the "reptilian brain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain)

are *not* fully under our control. Though, they can be influenced by shifting focus.

The only choice in our lives is what we currently focus on, and whether we influence focus at all.


# Happiness

No one knows how to be happy. Though, the sheer knowledge of what you can and can't control might give you room for creating happiness.

We all have our *choices*. Their **sequence maps to chaos** after minutes, months and years.
This, in fact, is the **real us**. Our **choices of momentary focus** are what makes us, *us*.

I thought about it after midnight in an important relationship. Connection. Whatever it might be called.

Every single choice is the hardest now.

> Before, he was unable to make a choice 'cause he didn't know what would happen.
> Now that he knows what will happen, he is unable to make a choice.

Thanks for reading.
