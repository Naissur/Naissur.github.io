## Product, place, market, relation, meaning, freedom, start, business, depression, creativity, genious, feedback

# Product

The first "P" in 4 P's is *Product*. The difference from creation is that *a product has its clients*.

# Clients' acquisition process

When you create the MVP, a potential client needs to find it, so that:

- *Firstly*, he can assess it
- *Secondly*, he makes a decision: whether he likes it or not
- *Finally*, he either discards it, or starts using it.

This is the *acquisition process*.

# Sales Pipeline

The KV Accounting *sales pipeline* may look like following:

- Signed up, but haven't signed in *(acquisition)*
- Signed in
- Entered one transaction
- Entered five transactions
- *Paid for the "pro" version* (if the monetization model is later chosen accordingly)

The main goal *at the start* is to **assess the clients' behavior** (feedback), and **make the right move afterwards**.

This is the cycle from *Lean Startup*.


# Goals for today/tomorrow:

- make an **interactive demo**
- *get my thoughts straight* on the **sales pipeline** process
- *create YM / GA triggers* to **assess clients' behavior**
- upload the KV Accounting video to [website](http://accounting.key-value.org)
- **initiate the shit on HN**
