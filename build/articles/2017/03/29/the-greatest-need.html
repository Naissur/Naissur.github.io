<h1 id="connection-meaning-life-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-antifragility-controlling-chaos-dramatic-murder">Connection, meaning, life, “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance”, Antifragility, controlling chaos, dramatic murder.</h1>

<p><br /> I wondered “Why?”,
<br /> And it turned out:
<br /> There’s no deny
<br /> That everything - is nothing. Doubt.
<br /> 
<br /> Fine, what do others say?
<br /> Einstein, Steve Jobs -
<br /> Do they just tell themselves, okay,
<br /> into some meaning of these “not”’s’?
<br /> 
<br /> “Creating” is too shallow.
<br /> “Connecting”’s not enough.
<br /> “Creating quality” is good, but not <em>too</em> good, though
<br /> The answer’s, also, not some “love”.
<br /> 
<br /> We live in chaos:
<br /> It is outside and inside.
<br /> And some of humans break; but others…
<br /> Get better from the randomnss, and they survive.
<br />
<br /> The name for it is contrary
<br /> To being fragile: it is named
<br /> <em>Antifragility</em>. So, here’s my word, accordingly
<br /> By which the life is tamed:
<br />
<br /> The highest need is in:
<br /> Controllably creating
<br /> Of <em>optional</em> (to both), and <em>antifragile</em> <em>bond</em>,
<br /> <em>With everything</em>.
<br />
<br /> <em>A bond</em> has a <em>conductor</em> of some sort.
<br /> For writer - books
<br /> For painter - art, in short,
<br /> For lovers - sex and looks.</p>

<hr />

<p><br /> This was a strong,
<br /> Dramatic murder of my dreams.
<br /> And then, you can’t go on,
<br /> Once all is simplified, when knowing what it means.
<br />
<br />
<br /> But when we’re bonded
<br /> In this way - becoming one,
<br /> Life’s colors amplify,
<br /> And quickly fade away, undone.
<br />
<br /> All the colors of the world
<br /> Are both beneath you, and inside.
<br /> The word has to be spread - you’re old
<br /> And thoughts - they are too low, too high.
<br />
<br /> And the many has become the one, reborn
<br /> Much more than sum of all:
<br /> Then, everything is broken, twisted, torn,
<br /> <em>Are bound, your mind and soul.</em></p>
