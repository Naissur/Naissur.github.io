<p>What is a <strong>pitch</strong>? Can you explain the structure and goals of your business in 30 seconds?
Having such constraints, you donâ€™t think immediately of unimportant details, and <strong>communicate the inner meaning</strong>.</p>

<p>The same happens when a drummer is given a constrain of playing a solo only on a smaller tom, and a kick.
Immediately, there is a central groove (<strong>idea</strong>), which is wrapped with details afterwards.</p>

<p>Hence, the structure of a <strong>perfectly pitched</strong> business fits :)</p>

<p>The meeting is going to be terrific. With blackjack, Erlang/OTP, and Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-pitch-erlang-in-a-few-sentences">How to pitch Erlang in a few sentences:</h2>

<p>There used to be a set of problems 20 years ago: <strong>programming fault-tolarant, non-fragile software is damn hard</strong>.
Hence, guys from Erlang were intrigued, and solved it in their language.</p>

<p>Sounds interesting, right? (<strong>Especially after 20 years of programming in C++</strong>)</p>

<p>The meeting is going to be terrific. With plans, programmming and coffee.
Just like in the passing light of day.</p>

<p>Plans for today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make my ideas known somewhere (doing it right now)</li>
  <li>Finish the Features List for persanal accounting app</li>
  <li>Look for a job</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds interesting? Write me an <a href="mailto:vlad.aituganov@gmail.com?Subject=Perfect%20Pitch">email</a> :)</p>
